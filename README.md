## Atlas-holbegram

This is an instagram clone. The tech stack being used is:

React Native for cross-platform mobile development
Firebase Firestore for scalable NoSQL cloud storage
Firebase Storage for media file storage
Redux for efficient state management
Expo for easy setup and deployment

## App Overview

Our Instagram clone will include most of the core features you‘d expect:

User authentication and account creation
Editing your profile and uploading a profile photo
Posting images with captions
Following/unfollowing other users
Personalized feed displaying posts from followed accounts
Liking and commenting on posts
Searching for users by name
The app architecture will consist of React Native on the frontend, interfacing with Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL cloud database, on the backend. We‘ll also utilize Firebase Storage, a dedicated file storage service, for hosting all of the images uploaded to the app.

To manage our app‘s state and data flow, we‘ll implement Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. And to streamline the React Native development process, we‘ll use Expo, an open-source platform that simplifies building, deploying, and iterating on native apps.
